The **InDi** (Improve Privacy and Trust in Non-Personalized Information Discovery) project is part of the **NGI Search** initiative funded by the **European Union** under grant agreement No. 101069364. InDi aims to create a **privacy-centric**, **transparent**, and **open-source** search engine with **debiasing**, **explainability**, and **anonymity** as core features. The project also includes a **crowdsourcing review platform** that leverages **human reviewers** to ensure search result quality through **manual validation**.

## Project Goals

The INDI project seeks to address key shortcomings in traditional search engines:

- **Bias and inequity**: Existing platforms often limit diverse perspectives and reinforce inequalities.  
  *InDi counters this by re-ranking results to prioritize debiasing, ensuring a diverse representation of perspectives.*

- **Opaque processes**: Users have limited insight into how search results are prioritized.  
  *InDi provides transparency through explainable artificial intelligence, offering users reasons for why certain results are ranked higher.*

- **Privacy invasion**: Search engines frequently track and exploit user data without consent.  
  *InDi enhances user privacy by anonymizing search queries and avoiding data collection, giving users control over their personal data.*

- **Erosion of trust**: These factors contribute to a lack of trust in search results.  
  *InDi seeks to rebuild trust by offering a decentralized, community-driven review process that ensures transparency in result validation.*
