# NGI INDI Project

## Introduction

The NGI INDI (Improve Privacy and Trust in Non-Personalized Information Discovery) project is part of the NGI Search initiative funded by the European Union under grant agreement No. 101069364. INDI aims to create a privacy-centric, transparent, and open-source search engine with debiasing, explainability, and anonymity as core features. The project also includes a crowdsourcing review platform that leverages human reviewers to ensure search result quality through manual validation.

## Project Goals

The INDI project seeks to address key shortcomings in traditional search engines:

- **Bias and Inequity**: Existing platforms often limit diverse perspectives and reinforce inequalities.  
  *INDI counters this by re-ranking results to prioritize debiasing, ensuring a diverse representation of perspectives.*

- **Opaque Processes**: Users have limited insight into how search results are prioritized.  
  *INDI provides transparency through explainable artificial intelligence, offering users clear reasons for why certain results are ranked higher.*

- **Privacy Invasion**: Search engines frequently track and exploit user data without consent.  
  *INDI enhances user privacy by anonymizing search queries and avoiding data collection, giving users control over their personal information.*

- **Erosion of Trust**: These factors contribute to a lack of trust in search results.  
  *INDI seeks to rebuild trust by offering a decentralized, community-driven review process that ensures transparency and quality in result validation.*

## Partners

- **University of Cagliari**: Key research partner with expertise in Information Retrieval, AI, and Semantic Web.
- **R2M Solution**: Business development partner providing industry experience and ICT activities.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the open-source community, including code improvements, feedback on user experience, and participation in the review process. You can participate in validation tasks or suggest improvements to ensure INDI meets its goals of enhancing privacy, transparency, and trust in online information discovery.
